Distance measurement using one or two cameras has various applications such as autonomous vehicles.

In this project, the distance of a selected object can be measured by a monocular or stereo camera.
1-Distance measurement by mono vision has been done using two algorithms. One of them is monodepth which is based on deep learning.
2-Distance measurement by stereo vision has been done using two algorithms based on deep learning, including PSM_net and SiamFC. Calibration of the stereo camera using a moving chessboard is required. 
Moreover a person in the picture can be detected using Yolo algorithm then the distance between the camera and the objective is measured by SiamFC algorithm.

The UI of this project has been completed using Qt and Python.
